Compiling Mudlet 1.1.0
----------------------

Use the Qt-4.6-SDK package from ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qtsdk/ or http://qt.nokia.com 
It comes with a binary distribution of the libs a ready made compiler for windows (mingw)  
(NOTE GNU/Linux: If you experience instability or weird behaviour of Mudlet link against the SDK libs instead of your distro's qt libs.)

1. DEPENDENCIES: 
================
required libs to compile Mudlet:
- Qt >=4.4 (included in the SDK)
- liblua-5.1 
- libpcre-7.8 or later

(NOTE: GNU/Linux: You'll always need the "dev" versions of the required libs if you use packages of your distro.)

additional packages that should be present on your system to get the full feature set of Mudlet:
(NOTE: Mudlet checks if these pacakges are available at runtime and can do without them if they cannot be found in the Lua path of your system. Check Mudlet's startup messages when connecting to see if Mudlet can find these extra packages.))
- luasql (http://www.keplerproject.org/luasql/)
- lrexlib (http://lrexlib.luaforge.net/) NOTE: You only need to compile the pcre module. The other modules of this lib are not used.
- sqlite3


2. COMPILING:
=============
   There are two ways to compile Mudlet.

1. CMAKE: The simplest: after having untared the source (tar xzvf mudlet-HEAD.tar.gz)
   cd mudlet
   ./build.sh (GNU/Linux) or build.bat (windows)
   make
   make install (not necessary)
   The binary can be found in mudlet/src/mudlet

2. FAILSAFE mode: Our cmake build doesn't work on all systems yet. So if you have problems you can use the
   manual way with qmake. You can adjust the paths to the dependencies in the project file
   mudlet/src/src.pro - simply look at the top of the file and adjust the paths you find to
   your own system. This is easy. If compile breaks with an error your paths are not correct.
   After having adjusted src.pro:
   make clean 
   qmake-qt4 (NOTE: On most systems there is qmake and qmake-qt4 qmake relates to the old qt version 3 qmake.)
   make
   make install

   The binary can be found in mudlet/src/mudlet or mudlet/src/release/mudlet.exe 

   Note: If you run into compiler problems then use build mode #2 and edit the file mudlet/src/src.pro in order to 
   change the INCLUDE and/or LIBS part of the make file and set the correct path on your system.



Good Luck.
