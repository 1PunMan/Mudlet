need to sort out single GIT repozitory for all mudlet code
	(well it's not so bad now ... there is one for lua and one for rest)


put all lua code in sepate subfolder (mudletHome/lua)
	amend LuaGlobal to load scripts from: mudletHome/lua
	add all lua files there (Geyser, DB, ...)


Lua Code
	test it properly e.g. that all functions are working
	update doc (as for help - after I'll do visible index)


LuaDoc
	change method to generate full link
	make index visible all the time (e.g. scroll bart with css) or frames

	gen LuaDoc and link it from main manual (e.g. this will be only API documentation)
		e.g. LuaDoc will replace Alphabetic Function List
	make generated LuaDoc more appealing (chekc lua/luadoc/doclet/html folder for it)
