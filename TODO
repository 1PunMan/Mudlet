need to sort out single GIT repozitory for all mudlet code
	(well it's not so bad now ... there is one for lua and one for rest)


put all lua code in sepate subfolder (mudletHome/lua)
	amend LuaGlobal to load scripts from: mudletHome/lua - nearly done
		mudletHome/mudlet-lua/lua


change genScript to generate documentation into (to make it more accesible)
	mudletHome/mudlet-lua/doc


Lua Code
	test it properly e.g. that all functions are working


LuaDoc
	gen LuaDoc and link it from main manual (e.g. this will be only API documentation)
		e.g. LuaDoc will replace Alphabetic Function List

	make generated LuaDoc more appealing (check lua/luadoc/doclet/html folder for it)
		this mainly includes better css
