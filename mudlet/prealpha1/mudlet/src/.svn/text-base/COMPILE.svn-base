Compiling up pre-alpha Mudlet
-----------------------------

On Windows:
Use the qt-4.4 binary distribution that comes bundled with a ready made compiler (mingw) at ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.4.3-mingw.exe . Simply install this package. Then download lua-5.1 and qscintilla2 sources and unpack the archives into "c:\". Then make both packages (lua with make mingw) and qscintilla2 with cd qt4 and then qmake and then make.
If all these packages are installed to c:\ the makefile of mudlet should work without adjustments. Compile mudlet by changeing into mudlet/src and then typing "qmake" and then "make release". You'll find the binary mudlet.exe in mudlet/src/release. To run mudlet you need to copy qscintilla2.dll and lua51.dll into the same directory that contains mudlet.exe.
If the compiler finishes with a "make[1]" type of error, it cant find the include files of qscintilla2 and lua51. Make sure to use the latest source packages of both and put them into c:\. If the compiler fails with a make[2] type of error the compiler can't find lua51.dll or qscintilla.dll. In this case you will have forgotten to compile those two packages prior to compiling mudlet. Good Luck.

Linux:

   1. install
          * g++ and the company
          * QT 4 development tools
          * qscintilla version 2.2 or higher
          * lua version 5.1 or higher

      Ubuntu users can do: sudo apt-get install build-essential libqscintilla2-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev qt4-dev-tools
      Others, see your distribution details for the said packages.
   2. navigate to the Mudlet directory, through the terminal, and do: make clean && qmake-qt4 && make
   3. wait until Mudlet compiles
   4. run mudlet by entering: cd src && ./mudlet
   5. Note: If you run into compiler problems then look at the file mudlet/src/src.pro and change the INCLUDE and/or LIBS part of the make file and set the correct path to the qscintilla2 include dir "Qsci" correctly. Note that each line in this file needs to end with a "\"
