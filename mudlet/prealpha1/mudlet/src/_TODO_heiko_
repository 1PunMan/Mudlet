Issues:
-------------------------------------

OPEN    offset timers don't work properly
OPEN    explode() + implode()
OPEN    regex lookup table for efficient lua regex usage
OPEN    buffer format bei wrap nach user recoloring auf default setzen
OPEN    optional NO antialiasing
OPEN    Modifying a regex shouldn’t require pressing Enter to update it - it should auto-update as you’re working on it
OPEN    “Actions” should really be called “buttons” everywhere
OPEN    Doesn’t warn when there is data loss involved (deleting / moving away from an unsaved item) - Brunos patches address this, but were reverted because the script editor got broken a lot
OPEN    Combobox connection dialog isn’t in (needs some fixing to compile)
OPEN    button text scripting
OPEN    compile buttons + message area
OPEN    autoconnection modul: neue profiletypen laden, anstatt alter


FIXED   remember last selected item in SE after tree switch
FIXED   multi toolbar support
FIXED   deleteLine()
FIXED   enable user windows again
FIXED   Default font might render bad on Windows (need to test) [COMMENT HEIKO: we definitely need either: a good windows font, that is guaranteed to be on the computer or ship our own free font -> vadi wanted to do this]
FIXED   replaceAll()
FIXED   drag and drop broken in keys: if parents had children once, but not anymore, they'll become a folder after restore();
FIXED   alias: ^asdf$ doesnt work anyore
FIXED   bugs in script editor
FIXED   profile loading final (needs more planning)
FIXED   child trigger/child timers
FIXED   command line
FIXED   And Trigger Filters (child triggers)
FIXED   multiline triggers don't work under very specific conditions -> analysis
FIXED   selectAll()


Doc:
-----------------------------------------

FIXED   Line margin isn’t explained




UI-Issues:
------------------------------------------

UI      “Add” button is missing a tooltip and is far away - while it should be on the same plane as the “Add to List” line, so the user can connect what is it for easier
UI      Timer scaling / alignment is quite broken



Future Versions:
---------------------------------------------

2.0     mapper
2.0     Timer timeline diagram
2.0     Making a new keybinding isn’t intuitive
1.0     Instead of a line and a button to get a new combination, we should instead just have 1 button that when pressed on, allows the user to set a new combination. Otherwise, it displays the current key combination. This is similar to how the colors are set in the Preferences dialog
2.0     Preferences ‘Close’ button is not the standard os-provided bytton - instead it’s a our own with no icon and closes in the ‘pressed’ signal instead of ‘released’
