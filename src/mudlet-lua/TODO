need to sort out single GIT repozitory for all mudlet code
	(well it's not so bad now ... there is one for lua and one for rest)


put all lua code in sepate subfolder (mudletHome/lua)
	amend LuaGlobal to load scripts from: mudletHome/lua
	add all lua files there (Geyser, DB, ...)


Lua Code
	test it properly e.g. that all functions are working
	update and polish docs


LuaDoc
	gen doc and link it from main manual
	make generated LuaDoc more appealing (chekc lua/luadoc/doclet/html folder for it)

	taglet - fix issue with links on tables and variables (@name, @class)	
	taglet - fix case sensitive <pre> tag - documented for now
