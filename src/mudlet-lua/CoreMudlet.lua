--- Like send(), but without bypassing alias expansion. This function may lead to infinite recursion if 
--- you are not careful. This function can be used to make recursive alias expansion. expandAlias("Hello Tom") 
--- echos the command on the screen expandAlias("Hello Jane") sends the command visually unnoticeable 
--- by the user send. <br/>
--- <br/>
--- Now, while in Mudlet you can call another alias with the expandAlias() function, this is strongly 
--- discouraged. What you do instead if create a function (for example, send()  and echo()  are functions) 
--- that you can then call from your alias or trigger. This has many advantages - it's faster, you can 
--- easily give your function values, and your function can return you values, too.<br/>
--- <br/>
--- Note: The variable "command" contains what was entered in the command line or issued via the expandAlias() 
--- function. If you use expandAlias( command ) inside an alias script the command would be doubled. You have 
--- to use send( ) inside an alias script to prevent recursion. This will send the data directly and bypass 
--- the alias expansion.

--- This function appends text at the end of the current line. The current cursor position is ignored.

--- Selects a substring from the line where the user cursor is currently positioned. You can move 
--- the user cursor with moveCursor(). When a new line arrives from the MUD, the user cursor is 
--- positioned at the beginning of the line. However, if one of your trigger scripts moves the 
--- cursor around you need to take care of the cursor position yourself and make sure that the 
--- cursor is in the correct line if you want to call one of the select functions. To deselect

--- Raises the event event_name. The event system will call the main 
--- function (the one that is called exactly like the script name) of all 
--- such scripts that have registered event handlers. If an event is raised, 
--- but no event handler scripts have been registered with the event system, 
--- the event is ignored and nothing happens. This is convenient as you can 
--- raise events in your triggers, timers, scripts etc. without having to 
--- care if the actual event handling has been implemented yet - or more 
--- specifically how it is implemented. Your triggers raise an event to tell 
--- the system that they have detected a certain condition to be true or 
--- that a certain event has happened. How - and if - the system is going to 
--- respond to this event is up to the system and your trigger scripts donâ€™t 
--- have to care about such details. For small systems it will be more 
--- convenient to use regular function calls instead of events, however, the 
--- more complicated your system will get, the more important events will 
--- become because they help reduce complexity very much. <br/>
--- <br/>
--- The corresponding event handlers that listen to the events raised with 
--- raiseEvent() need to use the script name as function name and take the 
--- correct number of arguments. NOTE: If you raise an event with 5 
--- arguments but your event handlers functions only take 2,10 or 0 
--- arguments, the functions will not be called. For example: 
--- raiseEvent("fight") a correct event handler function would be: 
--- myScript(event_name). In this example raiseEvent uses minimal arguments, name 
--- the event name. There can only be one event handler function per script, 
--- but a script can still handle multiple events as the first argument is 
--- always the event name. So you can call your own special handlers for 
--- individual events. The reason behind this is that you should rather use 
--- many individual scripts instead of one huge script that has all your 
--- function code etc. Scripts can be organized very well in trees and thus 
--- help reduce complexity on large systems. 
function raiseEvent(eventName, ...) end


--- Deletes the current Line under the user cursor. Note: This is a high speed gagging tool 
--- and it is very good at this task. It is meant to be used when the line can be omitted 
--- entirely in the output. If you want to replace this line with something else have a look 
--- at the replace() functions below. <br/>
--- Note that scripts such as: deleteLine(); echo("this line is gone"); will not work because 
--- lines that have been gagged with deleteLine() will not be rendered even if there is text
