This project contains all Mudlet lua code (lua folder). 


This will allow us to easily maintain it and generate common documentation with LuaDoc.
(We are using improved version of LuaDoc, because LuaDoc 3.0.1 is barely usable.)


You can generate doc on linux box with following command (mudlet-lua-doc folder).
You will need LuaDoc 3.0.1 (with custom improvements, which are in lua/luadoc folder)

	sh genDoc.sh
