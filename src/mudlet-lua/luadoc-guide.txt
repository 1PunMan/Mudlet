This file should give you basic guidelines for documenting mudlet-lua code 
with LuaDoc. (Keep in mind that we did few extensions to LuaDoc,
so this is not generic LuaDoc guide. All Mudlet LuaDoc extensions are 
freely available.)

I hope that everything will be clear from following example. 
You can always ask for clarification on Mudlet forum...
We would appreciate if you can follow this as close as 
possible to keep it consistent and easily maintainable. 
Thank you!



--- Short description, which should end with dot. More extended description
--- can be across many lines (including blank ones).
---
--- You can use pre tag anywhere you like. (Please indent it by 2 spaces.)
---   <pre>
---   if info ~= nil then
---      assert(info.name, "function name undefined")
---   end
---   </pre>
--- You can also force <br/> new line with HTML tag.
---
--- @release Mudlet 1.1.1
---
--- @param a is used for ... param description.
--- @param b LuaDoc will generate basic doc for all omitted parameters.
---
--- @return truu/false (to keep if brief)
---
--- @usage Description of example.
---   <pre>
---   test(1, 2)
---   </pre>
--- @usage Description of second example can be very long,
---   so I need to carry on following lines.
---   <pre>
---   local res = test("hit", 2)
---   echo(res)
---   </pre>
---
--- @see functionName
--- @see anotherFunctionName
---
function test(a, b) end


--- You can also document tables, but you have to manually set class and name tag.
--- Set class to 'function' for all tables or variables or it will not appear in master index!
---
--- @see fg
---
--- @class function
--- @name color_table
color_table = {}




OTHER NOTES:
------------
	- <pre></pre> is CASE SENSITIVE
	- you can document only functions and file
	- use <pre> </pre> tag for any code - even if it's just one line
	- you need to escape all html character like
