Compiling Mudlet
-----------------

On Windows:
-----------
Use the qt-4.4 binary distribution that comes bundled with a ready made compiler (mingw) 
at ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.4.3-mingw.exe . 
Simply install this package. Then download lua-5.1 and qscintilla2 sources and unpack the 
archives into "c:\". Then make both packages (lua with make mingw) and qscintilla2 with 

cd qt4 
qmake 
make

If all these packages are installed to c:\ the makefile of mudlet should work without adjustments. 
Compile mudlet by changeing into mudlet/src and then typing "qmake" and then "make release". 
You'll find the binary mudlet.exe in mudlet/src/release. To run mudlet you need to copy 
qscintilla2.dll and lua51.dll into the same directory that contains mudlet.exe.
If the compiler finishes with a "make[1]" type of error, it cant find the include files of 
qscintilla2 and lua51. Make sure to use the latest source packages of both and put them 
into c:\. If the compiler fails with a make[2] type of error the compiler can't find 
lua51.dll or qscintilla.dll. In this case you will have forgotten to compile those two 
packages prior to compiling mudlet. 

Good Luck.


GNU/Linux:
----------
Mudlet is developed on GNU/Linux (Debian Sid) 

1. REQUIREMENTS:
 * g++ (Ubuntu needs package build-essentials to be able to compile software 
   on Linux ... I can't believe it, but it seems to be true )
          
 * lib Qt4.4 or higher *development package* + development tools 
   (these usually ship in two different packages. If all fails download the sources of Qt4.5 or higher
   from www.trolltech.com and compile them (very easy, but takes up to 90 minutes)
          
 * qscintilla version 2.3 or higher. 
   NOTE: Ubuntu or Kubuntu 8.04 or 8.10 ship with 
   broken qscintilla2 packages. These lead to crashes after pressing the Enter key after
   deleting lines in the editor. Go and build qscintilla2 from source or use our Ubuntu ppa that 
   contains a fixed package.

 * lua version 5.1 or higher
   Ubuntu users can do: sudo apt-get install build-essential libqscintilla2-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev qt4-dev-tools
   Others, see your distribution details for the said packages.

2. navigate to the Mudlet directory, through the terminal, and do: 
   make clean && qmake-qt4 && make

3. wait until Mudlet compiles
4. run mudlet by entering: cd src && ./mudlet
5. Note: If you run into compiler problems then look at the file mudlet/src/src.pro and 
   change the INCLUDE and/or LIBS part of the make file and set the correct path to the 
   qscintilla2 include dir "Qsci" correctly. Note that each line in this file needs to end with a "\"
